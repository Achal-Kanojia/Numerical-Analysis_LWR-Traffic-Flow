# Numerical-Analysis_LWR-Traffic-Flow
It was a course project under the course Probability and Numerical Analysis done in a group of 4. The primary aim of our group was to understand the LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) traffic flow model, study its mathematical aspects, and build a numerical model to solve it.
A report prepared after building the basic understanding and analysis is attached to this repository, along with the MATLAB code used for analysis.
